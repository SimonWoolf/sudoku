Sudoku webapp. Just for fun (done at Makers). Ruby and Sinatra. Features a neat recursive solver, and a generator guaranteed to generate puzzles with a unique solution.

Part of the initial solver implementation was done pair-programming with [Bruce Steedman](https://github.com/MatzFan).

Install deps with `bundle install`, run with `rackup`, test with
`rspec`.

Running instance at http://sudoku.simonwoolf.net/. (Running on Heroku's free tier, so will take a few seconds to load the first time).
